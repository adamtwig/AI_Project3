598579557097086976,2015-05-13 20:04:22,I believe America still has that genius.
598579418378833921,2015-05-13 20:03:49,Only American leadership will bring safety and enduring peace.

598578531103211522,2015-05-13 20:00:17,It will reestablish a foreign policy based on strategy and principle rather than politics and polls.
598578498836385792,2015-05-13 20:00:09,This approach will restore American leadership to a world badly in need of it.
598578473053990913,2015-05-13 20:00:03,"Those are the 3 pillars of my doctrine‚Ää-‚ÄäAmerican Strength, the protection of our global economy &amp; proud advocacy for America‚Äôs core values"
598578171592638464,2015-05-13 19:58:51,"In this century, we must restore America‚Äôs willingness to think big‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto state boldly what we stand for and why it is right."
598577980298829824,2015-05-13 19:58:06,America is the first power in history motivated by a desire to expand freedom rather than its own territory.
598577908379033600,2015-05-13 19:57:49,"We must recognize that our nation is a global leader not just because it has superior arms, but because it has superior aims."
598577869342683136,2015-05-13 19:57:39,The third pillar of my doctrine is moral clarity regarding America‚Äôs core values.
598577842343923713,2015-05-13 19:57:33,"In this century, businesses must have the freedom to operate around the world with confidence."
598577684046712832,2015-05-13 19:56:55,"I will use American power to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space."

598577436436004865,2015-05-13 19:55:56,"Now, in the 21st century, you can access global markets in a single second, with a tap on your smartphone."
598577343901216769,2015-05-13 19:55:34,The second pillar of my doctrine is the protection of the American economy in a globalized world.
598576839670386688,2015-05-13 19:53:34,"So to restore American Strength, my first priority will be to adequately fund our military."
598576739996962816,2015-05-13 19:53:10,This is an idea that stems from a simple truth: the world is at its safest when America is at its strongest.
598576698322395136,2015-05-13 19:53:00,The first is American Strength.
598576671734702080,2015-05-13 19:52:54,My foreign policy doctrine consists of three pillars.
598576651794919424,2015-05-13 19:52:49,"Today, I intend to offer such a doctrine. And in the coming years, I intend to be such a president."
598576587617873920,2015-05-13 19:52:34,One who will set forth a doctrine for the exercise of American influence in the world.
598576562468827136,2015-05-13 19:52:28,The 21st century requires a president who will answer that question with clarity and consistency.
598576529359052801,2015-05-13 19:52:20,What principles should govern the exercise of our power?
598576496156901376,2015-05-13 19:52:12,The question before us is not ‚Äúshould we lead?‚Äù but rather ‚Äúhow should we lead?‚Äù
598576457997127680,2015-05-13 19:52:03,"We cannot bring about peace and stability on our own, but the world cannot do it without us."
598576347661750272,2015-05-13 19:51:36,The stakes of tomorrow are too high to look to the failed leadership of yesterday.
598576298907160576,2015-05-13 19:51:25,‚Ä¶ a leader from yesterday whose tenure as Secretary of State was ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst.
598576260395044864,2015-05-13 19:51:16,We simply cannot afford to elect as our next president one of the leading agents of this administration‚Äôs foreign policy‚Ä¶
598576192824823808,2015-05-13 19:51:00,It is up to our next president to properly fund and modernize our military.
598576172780236800,2015-05-13 19:50:55,It is up to our next president to right the wrongs done by our current one.
598576126605135872,2015-05-13 19:50:44,I believe the onus of maintaining American Strength lies where the buck stops.
598576090303475713,2015-05-13 19:50:35,"When we fail to lead with strength and principle, no other country, friend or foe, is willing or able to take our place."
598575820785913856,2015-05-13 19:49:31,We‚Äôve seen peaceful protestors met with violence from their governments.
598575796098240512,2015-05-13 19:49:25,We‚Äôve seen cyber-attacks against our allies and our own people.
598575777517477889,2015-05-13 19:49:21,We‚Äôve seen North Korea expand its nuclear arsenal and continue its brutal human rights violations.
598575740561428480,2015-05-13 19:49:12,We‚Äôve seen China rapidly expand its military capabilities and take aggressive action in the South and East China Seas.
598575671800037376,2015-05-13 19:48:55,We‚Äôve seen hundreds of thousands of Syrians slaughtered at the whim of a tyrant.
598575613583052800,2015-05-13 19:48:41,"We‚Äôve seen ISIL sweep across multiple states, commit brutal atrocities, and attempt to establish a caliphate."
598575546490982400,2015-05-13 19:48:25,This deterioration of our physical and ideological strength has led to a world far more dangerous than when President Obama entered office.
598575507630751745,2015-05-13 19:48:16,President Obama has embraced regimes that systematically oppose every principle our nation has long championed.
598575465628971010,2015-05-13 19:48:06,He criticized America for having ‚Äúarrogance‚Äù and the audacity to ‚Äúdictate our terms‚Äù to other nations.
598575430321315840,2015-05-13 19:47:58,President Obama demonstrated a disregard for our moral purpose that at times flirted with disdain.
598575359508893696,2015-05-13 19:47:41,He enacted hundreds of billions in defense cuts that left our Army on track to be at pre-World War II levels‚Ä¶
598575259734802433,2015-05-13 19:47:17,"Today, as never before, foreign policy is domestic policy."
598575207763181569,2015-05-13 19:47:05,Turmoil across the world can impact American families almost as much as turmoil across town.
