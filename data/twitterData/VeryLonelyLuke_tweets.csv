He never spent money &amp; only owned 1 outfit

693259895299272704,2016-01-30 02:30:13,"Don't talk to me until I've had my coffee.

God, I'm lonely."
693160942423654400,2016-01-29 19:57:01,"I told everyone exactly where I was going.

Do I look better with or without a beard?

It's too late to ask anyone."
692380878169833473,2016-01-27 16:17:19,"I turn around dramatically.

There's nobody there.

They keep them forever.

Except that rock.

That rock gossips.

I throw him into the ocean."
690537616572309504,2016-01-22 14:12:52,"I do 100 push-ups every morning.

But I'm old, so I use the Force.

My mind is so ripped."
690271706292822017,2016-01-21 20:36:14,"When Kylo Ren was little, he asked me how I lost my hand.

I said, ""Running with Scissors.""

He was afraid of arts and crafts after that."
690240020930772992,2016-01-21 18:30:19,"The emperor tried to kill me in the flashiest way possible

He did it for the shock value

That joke would be funny if he didn't kill my dad"
690222202625593344,2016-01-21 17:19:31,"I used to get Han the same gift every year.

Lint rollers.

Boxes of them.

Secretly, he hated flying with Chewbacca."
690200558418935808,2016-01-21 15:53:31,"I'm not truly alone.

I sense other life forms deep within the ocean.

I reach out to them with the Force.

Nothing answers.

Fish are dicks"
690181911126380545,2016-01-21 14:39:25,"Hoth wasn't my choice for a base

But Leia thought we could flip that icy dump for a profit

We wasted so much money on granite countertops"
689968991130030081,2016-01-21 00:33:21,"One time we threw a surprise party for Admiral Ackbar.

He screamed, ""It's a trap!""

He never stopped screaming.

He's in a psych ward now."
689930983341232128,2016-01-20 22:02:19,"A beautiful butterfly drifted by in the cool breeze.

The sudden motion startled me.

I killed it with my lightsaber."
689913191690833922,2016-01-20 20:51:37,"My dad didn't seem that surprised to find out he had 2 kids

I wonder if I have any other siblings

The Force is no substitute for a condom."
689889213811003393,2016-01-20 19:16:20,"When I feel lonely, I look up at the moon.

I think of all the people seeing what I'm seeing.

All 0 of them.

Then I feel 100 times worse."
689865715428499457,2016-01-20 17:42:58,"Living alone has one perk.

I can drink milk straight from the jug.

Or at least I could if I had milk.

Which I don't.

Fuck."
689821129284915208,2016-01-20 14:45:48,"It's a good thing I wear this long, flowing robe.

I walk up hundreds of stairs a day.

My calves are distractingly sexy."
689637770768289793,2016-01-20 02:37:12,"I wore a black turtleneck to my final showdown with Dad

He thought that meant I was leaning toward the Dark Side

But my neck was just cold"
689586392733716481,2016-01-19 23:13:02,"Obi-wan was a sad old man on Tatooine.

All he did all day was yell at Tusken Raiders to stay off his lawn.

I wish I had someone to yell at"
689556120797581312,2016-01-19 21:12:45,"I twisted my ankle on a rock in the middle of the night.

Now I'm afraid to walk around in the dark.

This used to be a good neighborhood."
689520358253166592,2016-01-19 18:50:38,"I don't think my dad was really conceived by midichlorians.

My grandma made that up so she didn't have to teach him about sex."
689502716008210432,2016-01-19 17:40:32,"That rock wasn't there yesterday.

Someone moved it.

Someone else is here!

Wait, I moved it.

No one else is here.

Damn that rock."
689474832505798656,2016-01-19 15:49:44,"My deal breakers for a relationship:

1) being related to me

That's pretty much it."
689439357141327872,2016-01-19 13:28:46,"My father did some truly awful, despicable things.

Then again, who am I to judge?

I made it to first base with my sister."
689308572623179776,2016-01-19 04:49:05,"Obi-wan ran away &amp; became a hermit

Yoda ran away &amp; became a hermit

My dad left &amp; became a Sith

I come from a long, proud line of quitters"
689205921839509504,2016-01-18 22:01:11,"Obi-wan used to rant about “sand people.”

I told him not to call them that.

That’s their word.

He didn’t understand.

Old people never do"
689164676840730624,2016-01-18 19:17:17,"Obi-wan basically let Vader kill him.

Not a great plan, bro.

You weren't more powerful as a ghost.

Living people can give advice, too."
689144256456470528,2016-01-18 17:56:09,"Sometimes I think I talk too much.

My dad was the strong, silent type.

Other than the wheezing.

God, he was annoying."
689116892557144065,2016-01-18 16:07:25,"Why do I stare at the ocean all day?

Because it’s blue.

Just like me."
689102384006623232,2016-01-18 15:09:45,"I only met my dad a few times.

All he wanted to talk about was me joining the family business.

He always put work before me."
689082427407515648,2016-01-18 13:50:27,"I have 300,000 followers.

I told all the rocks.

They didn't care, either."
688923440544395264,2016-01-18 03:18:42,"Han used to keep his house so cold

He wouldn't let Kylo Ren touch the thermostat

""I was on Hoth,"" Han always said. ""Put on a damn sweater"""
688861203960098817,2016-01-17 23:11:24,"Maybe it's for the best that I never got a dog.

The last time I played with someone's pet, I crushed its head under a giant steel door."
688819410631524352,2016-01-17 20:25:19,"Staring at the ocean all this time made me realize something important.

I should have brought sunglasses.

I've been squinting for 20 years"
688779843048239106,2016-01-17 17:48:06,"I wish I could finger paint, @TheWookieeRoars and @KyloR3n.

But it's kind of hard without paint.

Or 10 real fingers."
688742889032167425,2016-01-17 15:21:15,"Han and Leia made me an usher at their wedding.

I asked how I would know where to seat people.

Han said, “Use the Force.""

I hate that guy"

It swiveled and everything"

The family alerts need work."
688526210650009600,2016-01-17 01:00:15,"Jedi isn't a bad religion.

No church on Sundays, and I can move stuff with my mind.

The ""no sex ever"" policy is kind of a bummer, though."
688468085477650432,2016-01-16 21:09:17,"Lando blew up the Second Death Star.

The emperor would have died anyway.

I failed to save my dad's life.

I should have just stayed home."

2 suns

0 fathers"

Playing with teddy bears"

Oh.

Me neither."

I know that now.

Aunt Beru never checked the expiration date."
688108391932104705,2016-01-15 21:19:59,"Today I stared at the ocean

Then stared at a rock

Then stared at the ocean again

I've got to cut back

This hectic schedule is killing me"
688088611263234048,2016-01-15 20:01:23,"I could never sense Han with the Force.

But I could always smell him coming.

That carbonite odor never really went away."
688073450011930624,2016-01-15 19:01:08,"Han and Leia had a lot of trouble conceiving Kylo Ren.

Han was frozen in carbonite for over a year.

There was some freezer burn."
688058373456183297,2016-01-15 18:01:14,"I'm not surprised Kylo Ren went to the Dark Side

I told Han and Leia that he needed a brother or sister

Only children never turn out right"

Those two make me sick."
688012989878956032,2016-01-15 15:00:54,"I thought I would be Kylo Ren's godfather

Instead Han &amp; Leia picked Chewbacca

Why does everyone like that guy?

He doesn't even wear pants"
687997837439819776,2016-01-15 14:00:41,"Yoda acted like a hero when he lifted my X-wing out of the swamp.

Water ruins engines.

It took me hours to rebuild it.

Yoda took a nap."
687982688951742464,2016-01-15 13:00:29,"People think the Millennium Falcon was so cool

It was garbage

The bathroom didn't even work

When someone had to pee, they opened a window"
687966008292847616,2016-01-15 11:54:12,"I have no job.

No house.

No transportation.

And no girlfriend.

I'm lucky my parents are dead.

At least now I can't disappoint them."
687799096824958978,2016-01-15 00:50:58,"I found a stick.

There are no trees on this planet.

Where did it come from?

WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

Never mind

It's a long, skinny rock"
687754578780119040,2016-01-14 21:54:04,"I blew up my X-wing so I would be a hermit forever.

His Force power was Google"

Then I'll have to hang out with Yoda.

I'm sick of giving that asshole piggyback rides."
687684085892956160,2016-01-14 17:13:57,"Sometimes the Force lets me see into the future.

Like I know it's going to rain tomorrow

So I can change my plans

God, I wish I had plans"
687663302667833344,2016-01-14 15:51:22,"First Han said he shot first.

Then he said he didn't.

His story changed all the time.

I can't believe that guy is banging my sister."

Han's hand shot up.

That's why I left"
687626504080089089,2016-01-14 13:25:08,"The most difficult thing about being a hermit is the lack of recognition.

Han shrugged it off

Later I walked in on him crying about it

It was awkward for both of us"

I've been calling this one ""Hey, you"" for 20 years.

Now it's too awkward to ask."
687350961963151361,2016-01-13 19:10:14,"I'm tired of looking at this gosh darn ocean!

Sorry.

I shouldn't have lost control like that.

I have too much of my father in me."
687314741300191232,2016-01-13 16:46:18,"My dad offered me a job working for him.

I turned him down.

Blame the Common Core Jedi curriculum."

Now I have to pee."

A moss appetizer.

Moss for an entry.

Moss for dessert.

Control your jealousy.

It leads to the Dark Side."
686997443423125505,2016-01-12 19:45:28,"Leia used to brag she's never been tempted by the Dark Side.

They make terrible frenemies."

Everyone could be dead

I might be the only life form left

I can probably stop wearing pants."

I didn't get me anything.

I'm such a jerk."

It was called the USS Enterprise.

I told those guys to beat it.

Even I'm not THAT lonely."
683369741948456960,2016-01-02 19:30:17,"Why do people like to hear the sea?

It's the only noise here &amp; it NEVER stops

Quit being a dick for 10 minutes, ocean

I'm trying to sleep"
683362260580982784,2016-01-02 19:00:33,"Sometimes I think about going back to Cloud City and trying to find my hand.

It's probably long gone.

I bet a janitor swept it up."
683354674444001280,2016-01-02 18:30:25,"Literally the best part of being a hermit is there's no one to stop me from overusing ""literally.""

This is literally why I'll die alone."

1) Wake up

2) Stare at the ocean

3) Go to bed

I feel like I've overbooked myself.

I should cut back on the sleep."
683339568817516544,2016-01-02 17:30:23,"FYI, ""I'm running away to become a hermit"" is a pretty great excuse to get out of any awkward family function."
683338640408342528,2016-01-02 17:26:42,"No wonder no one likes me.

Apparently I can't even be lonely right.

I couldn't even train R2-D2

Oil stains are the worst."

683301834174365696,2016-01-02 15:00:27,"If someone visits, I'll tell them how I stare at the water

And they'll say ""That's all you've done?""

And I'll be like ""You should go now."""
683294239791411201,2016-01-02 14:30:16,"I made a new imaginary friend.

We had a fight.

Now he won't speak to me.

I am really bad at this."
683286721199472641,2016-01-02 14:00:23,"I'm the only Jedi left in the galaxy.

That's a lot of pressure.

The other Jedi all got out of it by dying.

That was very selfish of them."
683279124148916224,2016-01-02 13:30:12,"Maybe I don't deserve to be loved.

Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru loved me.

Go ask them how that worked out."
683271748373098496,2016-01-02 13:00:54,"I'm king of this island.

I make the rules.

The first rule is you must come here in person so I can tell you all the rules.

I'll wait."

Just kidding.

Nothing cuts deeper than a lightsaber.

It's a sword made of lasers."

It's one word long:

""Don't."""

Nobody liked that kid."

I sweat too much."
683203675989381120,2016-01-02 08:30:24,"I slept through my alarm this morning.

I got a late start on staring at the ocean for hours on end.

I hope I didn't miss anything."

Nobody came.

Not even me."
683188547839520768,2016-01-02 07:30:17,"Sorry if I use a lot of abbreviations and leave out punctuation marks.

It's hard to fit this much loneliness into 140 characters."
683181018468225024,2016-01-02 07:00:22,"I used to hate it when people wished me a merry Christmas.

I was right to run

I won't second guess myself"

His gold arm broke, and the red one was on sale.

Not sure why we made a big mystery about it."

683150801582329856,2016-01-02 05:00:18,"If I died right now, would anyone even notice?

Probably, because I would become a Force ghost and haunt them.

That would teach them."

That would be nice."

I hate it.

I hate it so very, very much.

Look at the results.

Worth it."

683097941461086208,2016-01-02 01:30:15,"No wonder nobody takes the Jedi seriously.

I listed my location as unknown and my job as hermit.

I win

They won't find me.

I need more coffee."

What does stormtrooper armor even do?

Literally everything kills them"
682946963051024385,2016-01-01 15:30:19,"It's not fair.

Hermit crabs get cool armor and awesome claws for pinching.

Hermit people just get sadness."

You can't eat the whole thing

I ordered one anyway

I ate it all"

I will say something stupid

God, it burns."
682916725747265536,2016-01-01 13:30:10,"My greatest power is being so awkward that people won't come near me.

It's like a force field."

My dad, the man who gave me half his DNA, was bald.

I'd rather die than lose my hair"
682901707068674048,2016-01-01 12:30:29,"If they asked, I'd join the Resistance.

Or the First Order.

Or the Jehovah's Witnesses.

Come get me.

I will accept literally any offer."

Don't have sex with anyone ever."

So what if all her friends are dead?

Some of us never had friends.

I hung out with sand."
682879058095505409,2016-01-01 11:00:29,"Other people stay away for a reason.

My awkwardness causes a disturbance in the Force roughly equal to Alderaan blowing up."

Why did I think this was a good idea again?

Oh, yeah. I remember.

Because I'm an idiot"

Or at least they would if they were here.

Which they are not.

Because I'm alone."
682856370870349824,2016-01-01 09:30:20,"Vader wore a mask because his face was disfigured by lava.

In his hut, everything was clouded.

He was always smoking pot."
682841254682603520,2016-01-01 08:30:16,"It's hard not to dwell on the past when I'm alone.

Like, why did Leia get to be a princess?

We're twins.

They made me a moisture farmer."
682833738049417216,2016-01-01 08:00:24,"Sometimes when I'm quiet, it sounds like the wind is saying my name.

And some truly horrible things about my mother."

He said they were too scary."

Deep down, I envy them."
682773316248170498,2016-01-01 04:00:18,"To be honest, none of us ever understood what Chewbacca said.

Half the time, he was just yawning."
682765746565451777,2016-01-01 03:30:13,"I can sense through the Force that something very bad just happened to Han.

I hope he didn't knock up my sister again."
682758235120635904,2016-01-01 03:00:22,"I have no one to confide in.

I had to tell my secrets to a rock.

Then I threw the rock in the sea.

I might have trust issues."
682750656344666113,2016-01-01 02:30:16,"I am literally thousands of light years from the nearest human being.

I still hear someone's stupid car alarm going off."

Of course you don't.

No one does.

I am alone."
682735553746472960,2016-01-01 01:30:15,"So what if I gained a little weight?

Working out is pointless.

I can lift a million pounds with the Force."

There's more than sharp rocks on the island

There are also sharper rocks

No sharpest rocks though

Wait there they are"

Or a ball.

Or a wall."
682712974247747585,2016-01-01 00:00:31,"Why did I become a Jedi?

It's so boring.

All we do is sit around and think.

I should have been a plumber."

""Boo hoo, I'm seething with dark anger.""

Well, get over it, Nancy.

Life is pretty shitty for all of us."

It didn't go very far

I levitated it to make it go farther

I cheated at my own game

I'll die alone"

By making him give me piggyback rides everywhere.

And that's why he turned to the Dark Side."

It made me happy.

A little too happy.

I threw it into the ocean."

682607345046781952,2015-12-31 17:00:47,"I look down at the beach.

During my troubled times, there is only one set of footprints in the sand.

Because I am alone.

Always alone."
682599700143423490,2015-12-31 16:30:25,"I look up at the moon.

""That's no moon,"" I say out loud.

No one laughs.

No one is here.

Maybe if I was funnier, I wouldn't be alone."
682592209309437952,2015-12-31 16:00:39,"I have the perfect disguise to help me stay hidden.

I look like I used to, but older and fatter.

No one will recognize me."
682584589177585665,2015-12-31 15:30:22,"Rey: Are you Luke Skywalker?

Me: No. Your Jedi is in another castle.

Rey:

Me:

Rey: Is that a reference to something?

Me: I have no idea"
682577133366034432,2015-12-31 15:00:44,"I will never get off this island.

I will be here until I die and become a Force ghost.

Then I will haunt this island until the end of time"
682569511724265473,2015-12-31 14:30:27,"I didn't fly here.

Leia dropped me off.

She said she had to run some errands and would be back in an hour.

That was 20 years ago."
682562030323240962,2015-12-31 14:00:44,"The say the ocean is eternal.

I bet I can outlast it.

I plant my feet firmly and face the water.

Game on, ocean."
682554383087878145,2015-12-31 13:30:20,"It's hard to take Kylo Ren seriously.

I still remember when he had potty training issues.

Wetting the bed is the path to the Dark Side."
682546878592991232,2015-12-31 13:00:31,"The ocean always ignores me when I talk to it.

Maybe I need to speak its language.

I make water noises with my mouth.

Still no response."
682540479125270528,2015-12-31 12:35:05,"I'm not crazy.

Crazy people talk to themselves.

I don't talk to myself.

Good point, self."
682534652406575105,2015-12-31 12:11:56,"I have so many good stories to tell about the last 20 years.

Like the one about how I stared at the ocean.

I guess that's my only story."
682524226084024320,2015-12-31 11:30:30,"This uncharted planet didn't have a name when I got here.

I decided to name it after my favorite thing in the universe.

Welcome to Taco."
682494032937926656,2015-12-31 09:30:32,"Apparently if I eat outside every day, it doesn't count as a picnic.

It counts as being homeless."

682478878166794240,2015-12-31 08:30:19,"I have a long history of avoiding people.

One time I jumped off a 1,000-foot ledge in Cloud City to avoid hanging out with my dad."
682471349223342081,2015-12-31 08:00:24,"Before I left, Kylo Ren said, ""You are my uncle. Tell me the secrets of the Force.""

And I said, ""I am your uncle. You get a noogie."""
682463776675860480,2015-12-31 07:30:18,"Ever do ""the stranger"" with a robotic hand?

I don't recommend it.

I need a doctor."
682456276606009345,2015-12-31 07:00:30,"I still remember when Leia told me about her and Han.

She said, ""He's banging me.""

I said, ""Who isn't?""

We haven't spoken since."
682448649398411264,2015-12-31 06:30:11,"The last time I sent my nephew Kylo Ren a birthday card, I didn't put any money in it.

Now he is a Sith lord.

It is not a coincidence."
682441108731916289,2015-12-31 06:00:14,"Kylo Ren kills people for fun.

He is my nephew.

Do I still have to send him a card for his birthday?"
682433541620297728,2015-12-31 05:30:09,"I made up an imaginary friend today.

He fell in the ocean and drowned.

His imaginary family blames me.

I'm facing an imaginary lawsuit."
682426008599920641,2015-12-31 05:00:13,"Next time I become a hermit, I'll do it on a desert planet.

I hate this sea air.

It makes my hair frizzy."
682418433850519553,2015-12-31 04:30:08,"Do you know what I hate about saltwater?

The salt.

And the water.

That's about it."
682410898397507585,2015-12-31 04:00:11,"I knew I'd be here for a while, so I made my supplies last.

I've been chewing the same piece of gum for 20 years."
682403335173988353,2015-12-31 03:30:08,"Fun date idea: You ask me out, and I avoid you because I'm a hermit."
682395799737741313,2015-12-31 03:00:11,"A Jedi is full of surprises.

You never know what I'm hiding under these robes.

It's a secret.

I will tell you anyway.

It's a fanny pack."
682388253513793537,2015-12-31 02:30:12,"Leia asked me to change one of Kylo Ren's diapers once.

I thought about it.

Then I ran away and became a hermit."
682380710938849280,2015-12-31 02:00:14,"I blew up the Death Star

There were thousands of people on board

I killed more people than my dad ever did

How do I feel about that?

Meh"

She stands in front of me.

I don't want to get my hopes up.

Maybe she is here to see a different hermit."
682365658059948032,2015-12-31 01:00:25,"I came here to solve the mystery of the Force.

I solved it.

The answer is midichlorians.

The answer is stupid.

I want to unsolve it."
682358092357611520,2015-12-31 00:30:21,"Do you know who would really like this water planet?

No one.

No one would like this water planet.

It is awful."
682350570905165825,2015-12-31 00:00:28,"I'm on an isolated island

On an isolated planet

In an uncharted part of the galaxy

The Mormons still found me

I pretended I wasn't home"
682342969584816128,2015-12-30 23:30:15,"How come every planet only has one terrain type?

Why is each one ALL desert or ALL water?
 
The ocean says nothing.

It silently mocks me."
682335463282085888,2015-12-30 23:00:26,"Why did I leave R2-D2 behind?

He had rocket boosters the whole time and never told me.

Serves him right."
682327885571604481,2015-12-30 22:30:19,"Time flies when you are having fun.

I am not having fun.

I think time has stopped.

I will be stuck on this island forever."

Take a guess

The rock doesn't answer

It's water

It's always water"

It said:

""Hey Leia,

This is Luke.

I have been staring at nothing for 20 years.

How are you?""

I threw the letter away"
682305315254235136,2015-12-30 21:00:38,"Why do I always watch the ocean?

I'm guarding against the greatest enemy of civilization:

Gungans.

If they show up, I'll kill them all."

682252393808015360,2015-12-30 17:30:20,"Living on a planet without any other humans is kind of nice.

I never come down with anything.

Or the flu.

Or love."

Please.

More like Han Duo.

I should be Luke Solo."

681754093455544320,2015-12-29 08:30:16,"I slept inside a dead tauntaun once.

That's why I have to live by myself now.

The smell never goes away."
681746568798715904,2015-12-29 08:00:22,"I play Scrabble against myself.

Why did I pack Scrabble?

Why didn't I pack food?

I eat the Scrabble pieces.

The Q's taste the best."
681738990140157952,2015-12-29 07:30:16,"Why does this place even exist?

Someone rolled up all the boredom in the galaxy and made a planet.

That's where I live.

A boredom ball."
681731444822163456,2015-12-29 07:00:17,"I live on Rock Island.

I stand on rocks.

I sit on rocks.

I sleep on rocks.

Next time, I will strand myself on Pillow Island."
681723895074930689,2015-12-29 06:30:17,"I sleep under the stars.

It makes me feel insignificant.

It makes me feel cold.

I wish I had a house."
681716351623368704,2015-12-29 06:00:18,"Vader killed the emperor.

What did I do?

I looked cool in a black turtle neck.

That was enough."
681708780321685504,2015-12-29 05:30:13,"I love the smell of the sea

Or at least I did before I smelled nothing but the sea every day for 20 years

My nose is on fire

Make it stop"
681701237411213312,2015-12-29 05:00:15,"How come only Sith lords get to pick new names?

Kylo Ren is a cool name.

Luke Skywalker is not.

From now on, call me Dude Johnson."
681693663836127232,2015-12-29 04:30:09,"I have advice for Kylo Ren.

Always buy double ply toilet paper.

Oh, and turn back to the Light Side.

But mostly the toilet paper thing."
681686122171338753,2015-12-29 04:00:11,"I throw a rock off the cliff

It reminds me of the emperor falling down that bottomless pit

Except it doesn't scream

What's wrong with me?"
681679800625414144,2015-12-29 03:35:04,"I've been silently pouting for 20 years and no one even came to check on me.

I wasted this entire temper tantrum."
681671040276250624,2015-12-29 03:00:15,"""Don't tell anyone, but I ran out of toothpaste 20 years ago,"" I whisper to myself through a mouth without any teeth."
681663469993734144,2015-12-29 02:30:10,"I only brought one book with me.

It teaches me to guard against true evil.

I hate the Grinch."
681655970418798592,2015-12-29 02:00:22,"I didn't mean to stay this long

I can't find my X-wing.

I hit ""lock"" on my key fob.

I listen for the horn

I've been looking for 20 years"
681648421728579586,2015-12-29 01:30:22,"I fill a water bucket

I go up 400 stairs

I go down 400 stairs

I dump the water on the island's other side 

Soon one side will be empty"
681640910543794177,2015-12-29 01:00:32,"""I'll gut you like a fish!"" I yell at a fish.

The fish is unimpressed.

It calmly swims away."
681633301879230464,2015-12-29 00:30:17,"""Maybe Kylo Ren is evil because you're a bad father!"" I shout to no one

I've got to keep my voice down

The rocks are looking at me funny"
681625810026008576,2015-12-29 00:00:31,"I make a pile of rocks.

I call it Han.

It looks just like him.

It's just as smart as him, too."
681618200816160768,2015-12-28 23:30:17,"I tried to be a cool uncle.

Now my nephew is a Sith lord.

I can't believe I took him fishing."
681610694349959169,2015-12-28 23:00:27,"I write ""Leia"" on a rock.

It falls over and rolls next to the rock labelled ""Han.""

They should get a room."
681603106723991552,2015-12-28 22:30:18,"Why do I wear loose-fitting robes?

Because the Jedi order demands it.

And because I gained some weight over the holidays."
681595576505528321,2015-12-28 22:00:23,"The emperor wanted me.

Vader wanted me.

The rebels wanted me.

Back then, EVERYONE wanted me on their team.

Call me.

I'm a free agent."
681588003932864516,2015-12-28 21:30:18,"The first Jedi temple is underwater.

There's only one explanation.

The first Jedi were mermaids."
681580546523279360,2015-12-28 21:00:40,"The girl stares at me.

I cannot talk to her.

I ran away to this planet to be a mime.

Help me out of this invisible box."
681572938244579328,2015-12-28 20:30:26,"I played Hungry Hungry Hippos today

I worked one hippo with each hand

I worked the other two hippos with the Force

I'm so lonely it hurts"
681565473683668992,2015-12-28 20:00:46,"I'm throwing a party to celebrate my anniversary as a hermit.

No one is invited."
681557832924303361,2015-12-28 19:30:24,"I wish someone would tell me what's going on in the rest of the galaxy.

I bet the First Order went away on its own.

That usually works."
681550335291342848,2015-12-28 19:00:37,"I don't mind being alone.

I am a solitary soul.

I have no need of companionship.

I should have brought a dog."
681542759296200704,2015-12-28 18:30:30,"I could count all my friends on two hands.

I could count them all on one hand.

I could count them all on zero hands."
681535259440201728,2015-12-28 18:00:42,"There are some who say I talk to myself too much.

At least I assume that's what they say.

I never talk to them.

I only talk to myself."
681527647952879618,2015-12-28 17:30:28,"I came to a water planet to seek out the first Jedi temple.

I didn't bring a boat.

I see no flaws in this plan."
681520254405722112,2015-12-28 17:01:05,"I don't miss R2-D2.

He made his choice.

I made mine.

I make beeping noises to fill the silence."
681512572647018496,2015-12-28 16:30:33,"""You will be my friend,"" I say.

But the rock is immune to my Force powers.

He is not my friend."
681505073663455233,2015-12-28 16:00:45,"Being a hermit on the edge of the galaxy isn't as easy as it sounds.

None of my Amazon Prime orders show up on time."
681497469868490752,2015-12-28 15:30:33,"I wonder what Han is up to right now?

Probably living a long, happy life."
681489971203670016,2015-12-28 15:00:45,"My dad used to complain that he didn't have a dad.

Well, boo hoo.

I don't have a grandfather.

That's not easy, either."
681482343312392192,2015-12-28 14:30:26,"I promised myself I'd never be a crazy hermit in the desert like Obi-wan.

Now I'm a crazy hermit on a water planet.

Totally different."
681474857318629376,2015-12-28 14:00:41,"I reflect on all the lives I've taken

I don't care about the countless men on the Death Star

But those poor womp rats in Beggar's Canyon"
681467216454397952,2015-12-28 13:30:20,"I didn't consider the true cost of becoming a hermit.

I've missed like 10 iPhone upgrades."
681459714157342720,2015-12-28 13:00:31,"Someone find me.

My address is in the phone book.

Are phone books still a thing?

Yes.

This is a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away."
681452107740917760,2015-12-28 12:30:17,"I didn't bring balance to the Force.

My dad did.

I'm just a supporting character in his story.

What a showoff."
681444264191090688,2015-12-28 11:59:07,"I lost track of what day it is.

I decide today is my birthday.

I decide every day is my birthday.

I receive no gifts.

I am sad."
681437072104787968,2015-12-28 11:30:33,"I see a light in the distance.

Is it a friend?

It is not a friend.

It is the sun.

Go away sun.

I have no use for you anymore."
681429563491106820,2015-12-28 11:00:42,"Makes words hard, time alone does.

Use them often, I do not.

Get it, Yoda, I finally do."
681421935906009088,2015-12-28 10:30:24,"I use the Force to remove one stair

Whoever walks on it next will fall

I am now safe

I walk on it next

I am not safe

Not safe at all"
681414435324428288,2015-12-28 10:00:36,"Rock, you are my only friend.

The rock falls in the ocean.

I have no friends."
681406852761006081,2015-12-28 09:30:28,"I forgot to have my Rebel Alliance pension checks forwarded here.

I hope R2-D2 isn't cashing them."
681399302795689984,2015-12-28 09:00:28,"I drank six extra cups of coffee.

Now I'm super awake for all the nothing I have to do today."
681391709423562753,2015-12-28 08:30:17,"I did some Yoga to calm my nerves.

I couldn't get the poses right.

It made me angry.

Yoga is the path to the Dark Side."
681384224922931200,2015-12-28 08:00:33,"Congratulations, you found me.

Here is your prize.

It is me.

Wait, don't go!

You forgot your prize."
681376617130790912,2015-12-28 07:30:19,"The girl stares at me.

Why is she here?

She's probably selling something.

If I stay perfectly still, maybe she'll go away."
681369094935973888,2015-12-28 07:00:26,"Remember when I blew up the Death Star?

No you don't

That's why I'm here alone

Maybe if I blow up two Death Stars you'll finally love me"
681361614822572032,2015-12-28 06:30:42,"I own zero chairs.

That's just enough seats for all the friends I don't have."
681353987866628097,2015-12-28 06:00:24,"Who let the dogs out?

I let the dogs out.

But I can never tell anyone because I'm all alone."
681346401465417728,2015-12-28 05:30:15,"I check my email inbox.

It is empty.

I don't even get spam."
681338870580047872,2015-12-28 05:00:20,"I open my journal.

Time to list my accomplishments for the day.

I'm still alive.

That concludes my list of accomplishments."
681331300385554432,2015-12-28 04:30:15,"Why do the Jedi even need a temple?

The Force is everywhere.

I could be at one with the Force from my own couch.

I miss my couch."
681323790945652736,2015-12-28 04:00:24,"I flew without R2-D2

His entire job is to tell me where to go when I travel through space

I got lost

Now I'm stuck here

Lesson learned"
681316240053370880,2015-12-28 03:30:24,"I have a mixtape ready for if anyone shows up after all this time.

It's just one song over &amp; over.

No one says ""Hello"" better than Adele."
681308725836156929,2015-12-28 03:00:33,"I realized something today as I walked up these 400 stairs.

This must really be a Sith temple.

The Jedi would have installed an escalator."
681301135756537856,2015-12-28 02:30:23,"I bought an awesome Groupon today.

All I need is three friends to use it.

I throw the Groupon in the ocean."
681293603994472449,2015-12-28 02:00:27,"I never should have trained Kylo Ren

There's only one way to fix this mistake

I will hide on an uninhabited planet forever and do nothing"
681286043404992516,2015-12-28 01:30:25,"No one will ever find me.

I left no clues about where I went.

Except for a giant, glowing map that leads right to me."
681278519759007744,2015-12-28 01:00:31,"Every day I throw more rocks into the ocean.

Eventually, I will fill it up.

I will defeat you, ocean."
681270911387983873,2015-12-28 00:30:17,"I look up at the stars.

I wonder if there is intelligent life out there.

I think of Han and Chewie and Leia.

There is not."
681263382889119744,2015-12-28 00:00:22,"There's only one reason I came to an island that has 400 stairs.

*pulls out my skateboard*

Let's do this."
681255809762877442,2015-12-27 23:30:16,"I thought running away from everyone would improve my life.

Now I poop in a hole in the ground.

Someone get me out of here."
681248300545249281,2015-12-27 23:00:26,"The first Jedi temple is out in shallow water.

I walked there once.

My socks got wet.

I'm never going back."
681240709077331968,2015-12-27 22:30:16,"""Hello!"" I shout.

I hear only silence in return.

Even my echo ignores me."
681233202103631872,2015-12-27 22:00:26,"Every day I wake up and wonder if today is the day a Death Star will blow up my planet.

Today is not that day.

I am disappointed."
681225597222273025,2015-12-27 21:30:13,"I dropped my phone.

It fell down 400 stairs.

I still have a year left on my plan.

Good thing no one ever calls me anyway."
681218080912109568,2015-12-27 21:00:21,"I don't have to be lonely.

I can make a sock puppet.

I'm not wearing any socks.

I will die alone."
681210504501657600,2015-12-27 20:30:15,"Maybe I can befriend a dolphin.

I wait on the beach.

I wait and wait.

No dolphin comes.

If one ever does show up, I will eat it."
681203039294894080,2015-12-27 20:00:35,"I have a perfectly valid reason for traveling 1,000 light years away from everyone I know.

I need privacy to practice my new dance moves."
681195441053155328,2015-12-27 19:30:23,"I got in a 20 minute argument today.

It was with myself.

I lost."
681188050978926592,2015-12-27 19:01:01,"There's a vending machine on this island.

It has all the snacks I ever wanted.

I forgot my money.

Those M&amp;Ms haunt my dreams."
681180335925805056,2015-12-27 18:30:22,"I wish I would have brought my lightsaber.

It makes a great night light."
681172825969934336,2015-12-27 18:00:31,"I sent R2-D2 back to tell all my friends exactly where I am.

I sure hope he doesn't randomly go into low-power mode for 20 years."
681165226448936962,2015-12-27 17:30:20,"I'll never forget the wise words of master Yoda...

""Blah blah blah something backward."""

Particle by particle, it washes the land into the sea

I put on my swimming trunks expectantly"
681150134198087681,2015-12-27 16:30:21,"I've been trying to leave this place for years.

I contacted an Uber driver.

He just laughed at me."
681142616780632064,2015-12-27 16:00:29,"I didn't have to buy a single Christmas gift this year.

Being a hermit on an abandoned planet has advantages."
681135017645490176,2015-12-27 15:30:17,"When I close my eyes, I can still sense my father in his final moments.

He smelled like burning hot dogs."
681127498306945024,2015-12-27 15:00:24,"I can see why the first Jedi abandoned this place.

I tripped and fell down 400 stairs.

There are no safety railings anywhere."
681119911586967552,2015-12-27 14:30:16,"I don't need other people to be happy.

I need booze to be happy.

Someone bring me booze."
681112369330786304,2015-12-27 14:00:17,"I've been walking up and down these stairs for years.

I should be in amazing shape.

I am not.

I blame the Sith."
681104962634559488,2015-12-27 13:30:52,"Everyone know exactly where I am.

But no one wants to come see me.

There are too many stairs."
681097377978122240,2015-12-27 13:00:43,"I chose this island full of birds so I could be one with nature.

Then I got hungry.

There are no more birds."
681082237031419905,2015-12-27 12:00:33,"I am playing a galactic game of hide and go seek.

I am winning.

I wish someone was looking for me."
681082236570087425,2015-12-27 12:00:33,"I've mastered every Jedi art I can think of.

I still can't fly.

The Force is a constant source of disappointment."
681074635115499521,2015-12-27 11:30:21,"I'm a good teacher.

Only one of my students turned to the Dark Side and killed a bunch of people.

I only had one student."
681067136975015936,2015-12-27 11:00:33,"Today I tried to set a new record for how long I can hold my breath underwater.

I held my breath until I passed out.

I don't have a watch."
681059538825527296,2015-12-27 10:30:22,"No one remembered my birthday this year.

Not even me.

I am so mad at me right now."
681052043017097216,2015-12-27 10:00:35,"Maybe I shouldn't have run off to be a hermit.

Now I'll never know how ""The Sopranos"" ended.

I bet it had a good ending."
681044424437198848,2015-12-27 09:30:18,"I came here for silent contemplation.

I've had the same song stuck in my head for 10 years.

Better luck next decade."
681036884739526656,2015-12-27 09:00:21,"This sea air is corroding my robotic hand.

All it can do now is wave.

I have no one to wave to."
681029305762185216,2015-12-27 08:30:14,"I miss R2-D2.

His hard drive has all my iTunes."
681021775380090880,2015-12-27 08:00:18,"Want to be a Jedi like me?

Put on a robe.

Grow a beard.

That's it.

I just saved you 20 years at Jedi school."
681014196474130432,2015-12-27 07:30:11,"I don't want to bring balance to the Force.

I just want a chair.

These rocks hurts my butt.

Even a stool would do."

I came here to hide from spiders.

If you are a spider, please leave."
680991542593630208,2015-12-27 06:00:10,"Nothing will ever fill the emptiness inside me.

Except for ham.

Someone bring me some ham."
680984015474704384,2015-12-27 05:30:16,"It's just me, an old man.

And the sea.

Someone should write a book about that.

It would probably suck."
680976462665613312,2015-12-27 05:00:15,"Hello, ocean.

Will you be my friend?

Answer me, ocean.

Ocean, you are a dick."
680968892567654401,2015-12-27 04:30:10,"You are not lonely.

You are NOT lonely.

YOU ARE NOT LONELY.

Apparently I can't do Jedi mind tricks on myself."
680961361443188736,2015-12-27 04:00:14,"I don't need food.

I have the Force to sustain me.

I have scurvy."

He never came.

Bad, dog. Bad."
680946255548301312,2015-12-27 03:00:13,"Being alone doesn't make me crazy.

It makes YOU crazy.

I scream this at a pile of rocks.

A very crazy pile of rocks."
680938699455115264,2015-12-27 02:30:11,"I sneezed.

No one said ""bless you.""

I feel so unblessed."
680931161611350016,2015-12-27 02:00:14,"I found another living creature.

It was a bug.

It bit me.

I hate everything."
680923615492190208,2015-12-27 01:30:15,"I found the first Jedi temple.

Now I know why all the Jedi left.

This planet sucks."
680916086628462593,2015-12-27 01:00:20,"I will not stare at the ocean today.

Today is my day off.

I close my eyes.

Go away, ocean."

Except for drugs.

Drugs are better."

They don't answer because they don't exist.

Typical."
680893417895886848,2015-12-26 23:30:15,"I take a nap.

I take a second nap.

I stare at the ocean.

It is a busy day."

No one answers.

Conversation complete."

I throw it into the ocean.

I miss the rock."

""Six,"" I guess.

I am wrong."
680863265354838020,2015-12-26 21:30:26,"I clear my mind to become one with the Force.

Then I remember that time I tried to make out with my sister.

I will never be at peace again"
680855783425314821,2015-12-26 21:00:43,"Being a Jedi isn't all bad.

I've been sitting around in my bathrobe for decades."

I hate my life."

He is my reflection.

I smash him with a rock."
680817967404335104,2015-12-26 18:30:27,"I wish Kylo Ren were here.

I want to talk him out of being evil.

I want to talk to him period.

I want to talk to anyone.

I am alone."
680810463677018112,2015-12-26 18:00:38,"I look at my to-do list for the rest of my life.

Stare at the ocean?

Check.

I have nothing left to do.

I play Angry Birds on my phone."
680802871521218560,2015-12-26 17:30:27,"The Force fills me with inner peace.

I don't want inner peace.

I want chicken nuggets.

The Force does not fill me with chicken nuggets."
680795346205831170,2015-12-26 17:00:33,"The strange girl with the lightsaber stares at me.

What does she want?

Maybe she brought toilet paper.

I did not bring enough."

So very blue.

So very, truly deeply blue.

Stop being so damn blue, ocean!

I hit the ocean with a stick

It ignores me"

He is a ghost and can appear anywhere he wants.

He does not appear here.

Ghost Obi-wan is a dick."
680765106037325824,2015-12-26 15:00:23,"The worst part about the Starbucks barista spelling my name wrong is there is no barista and no Starbucks.

I am alone."
680757514045108224,2015-12-26 14:30:13,"All I need to be content by myself is the Force.

It went straight to voicemail."

I was disappointed.

I won't do that again."

680595741501435904,2015-12-26 03:47:24,"I have no idea why people keep saying they can't find me.

I listed my new address on my Facebook page.

All my friends are assholes."
680594895145439232,2015-12-26 03:44:02,"I am my own best friend.

And my own worst enemy.

It was me."

Who's there?

No one.

Is she trying to stab me?

You have to turn it on first, idiot."

I'm still silent

I can't start talking now without it being awkward

I have to pretend I don't see her forever"

I made them up so people wouldn't know I'm talking to myself."

680478970735947777,2015-12-25 20:03:23,"I could stare at the ocean forever.

Or at least I thought I could.

This planet sucks."

Ever.

I'm serious.

This is hell."

I swear I'm not lonely."
680377932536262656,2015-12-25 13:21:54,"I decided to stare at the ocean in a different direction today.

I didn't like it.

I turned back around."
680377763988111362,2015-12-25 13:21:14,"I've been deep in thought for years, but there's one thing I still don't understand.

Who has been mowing the grass here?"
680369837588221952,2015-12-25 12:49:44,"I feel like swimming, but the ocean is full of space monsters.

Everything is full of space monsters.

What is wrong with this galaxy?"
680369430824632320,2015-12-25 12:48:07,"It's way too hot here to be wearing all these robes.

Why didn't the ghost of Obi-wan warn me to bring shorts?"
680369171427897345,2015-12-25 12:47:05,"I saw a person for the first time in years.

She held out a lightsaber.

I just stared at her awkwardly

What the hell is wrong with me?"
680276330718572544,2015-12-25 06:38:10,"Standing here by myself never gets old.

Nope.

Having the time of my life.

*checks watch*

How am I not dead yet?"
680273219589423104,2015-12-25 06:25:49,I wish I had a volleyball to talk to.
680273152753184768,2015-12-25 06:25:33,My greatest fear is that I smell bad but I've been here by myself so long I don't notice it anymore.
680273014328549376,2015-12-25 06:25:00,"I used the Force to move some rocks.

Then I used the Force to move them back.

It was a big day.

I should take a nap."
680272364916060160,2015-12-25 06:22:25,"I skipped a stone 10 times today and I totally high fived myself.

That's a thing normal people do."
680272171843883008,2015-12-25 06:21:39,I wish I would have brought some cards to play solitaire or something.
680272015119507456,2015-12-25 06:21:01,"I thought I heard another person today.

It was my own echo.

I talked to it for three hours."
680271851361320960,2015-12-25 06:20:22,"I'm not lonely.

There's lots to do on this planet.

Like staring at the water.

And then staring at the water some more.

Fun times."
