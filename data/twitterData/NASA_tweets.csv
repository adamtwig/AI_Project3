662376319838212096,2015-11-05 21:09:55,@ddubb710 The radiation environment on the surface of Mars is something that we're monitoring with @MarsCuriosity
662375988341395456,2015-11-05 21:08:36,@murmaidsci88 We do know that it had a field because there are parts of the ancient Mars crust that are still magnetized.
662375849652563968,2015-11-05 21:08:03,"@Dustin_LongNJ We believe that the atmosphere that was lost, has been lost forever to interplanetary space."
662375655896649729,2015-11-05 21:07:17,@gau3tam7 Earth’s magnetic field largely protects it from these processes.
662374562110308352,2015-11-05 21:02:56,@BWest187 Storms on the sun happen all the time. These storms increase the UV &amp; radiation environment that affect biological life adversely.
662371701464911872,2015-11-05 20:51:34,@Hamda930 A compass would not point toward North at Mars. It would point toward the nearest and strongest crustal magnetic field.
662371451916390401,2015-11-05 20:50:35,@Wjkirik The amount of liquid water on Mars is trace amounts. MAVEN is looking on a larger scale.
662371360941981696,2015-11-05 20:50:13,"@meekelis We see ancient dry river beds, ancient dry lakes - so Mars had to have had a thick atmosphere early on to support liquid water"
662371115931705344,2015-11-05 20:49:14,@srthvnnn Potentially small amount during the geologically brief time of switch. Earth's bigger w/ more gravity so hard for atoms to escape
662371072709435392,2015-11-05 20:49:04,@MinaVesperGokal Any small scale magnetic field could potentially deflect local solar wind.
662370915796299776,2015-11-05 20:48:27,"@MenTor193 It used to. It was small, froze and stopped making a magnetic field."
662370700402016256,2015-11-05 20:47:35,"@truthordoor Both formed at about the same time, around 4.5 billion years ago."
662370654424064000,2015-11-05 20:47:24,"@SpeakSpanglish The @Space_Station can see the Earth’s aurora, which are caused by solar winds entering the Earth’s atmosphere."
662370536006270977,2015-11-05 20:46:56,"@lngsd The Venus atmosphere is very thick. Similar processes are happening there, but so far it’s still a thick atmosphere."
662370391785123843,2015-11-05 20:46:22,"@Shankovich Yes, MAVEN measured solar wind on the way to Mars. It would depend on the shielding that the spacecraft would have."
662370210247217152,2015-11-05 20:45:39,"@RussellGarcia The rate of change in the loss is also due to solar activity, which we expect was greater during an early sun."
662370095239454720,2015-11-05 20:45:11,"@akgadam Magnetic fields originate at the core of planets. Mars is smaller than Earth, so the core had less heat to keep it molten."
662369906667614208,2015-11-05 20:44:26,@DanielRika2 Earth is bigger &amp; our core hasn't frozen. We still have a global magnetic field on Earth that helps shield us from solar winds
662369753466609664,2015-11-05 20:43:50,"@BelleBella94 We believe that the Mars atmosphere and climate were significantly different billions of years ago, so yes."

662369628958662656,2015-11-05 20:43:20,@extrapale That is part of MAVEN’s investigation. We hope be able to estimate this.
662369481386258432,2015-11-05 20:42:45,@GunzSonny It’s very unlikely that this would happen. We think much of it was blown away forever.
662369421189627912,2015-11-05 20:42:30,@DigitalAbdullah MAVEN science results will help us understand and shape what astronauts will be studying at Mars.
662369352033935360,2015-11-05 20:42:14,@yudisz It widely varies. Summertime at the equator it can get to as high as 10 degrees celsius. But in general it’s much below freezing.

662369186388275200,2015-11-05 20:41:34,@WindmarkUS We don’t know for sure. But we think that Mars' core was small and froze because there was less heat to keep it molten.
