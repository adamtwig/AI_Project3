# DocumentClassifier (CIS 678 - Project 2)

## Authors
Michael Baldwin, Joshua Engelsma, Adam Terwilliger

## Objective
Document Classification using the Naive Bayes Algorithm

## Future Work
- N grams (uni-grams, bi-grams, tri-grams)
- Maximum entropy classifier
- Clustering similar topics

### Other Ideas  
#### Word frequency (lists of words and their frequencies)  
#### Collocation (words commonly appearing near each other)   
#### Concordance (the contexts of a given word or set of words)  
#### N-grams (common two-, three-, etc.- word phrases)  
#### Entity recognition (identifying names, places, time periods, etc.)  
#### Dictionary tagging (locating a specific set of words in the texts)  
#### [Word Cloud Visualization](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud)

### High-level Goals for Text Analysis  
- Document categorization  
- Information retrieval (e.g., search engines)  
- Supervised classification (e.g., guessing genres)  
- Unsupervised clustering (e.g., alternative “genres”)  
- Corpora comparison (e.g., political speeches)  
- Language use over time (e.g., Google ngram viewer)  
- Detecting clusters of document features (i.e., topic modeling)   
- Entity recognition/extraction (e.g., geoparsing)  
- Visualization
